merkledag-ref
=============

Reference tracking for [MerkleDAG](https://github.com/greglook/merkledag-core)
graphs.

A 'ref' is very similar to a ref in git - it is a named, mutable pointer to a
node in an immutable graph. In another way, it's similar to the various
concurrency ref types in Clojure, because a ref represents a stable identity for
a changing state.
